<p class="first">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', <span>making</span> it look like readable English.
</p>

<p class="second">Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. <span>Various</span> versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
